##  Implement Language Detection for Text
Create a Python Script
Open VS Code, create a new file named language_recognition.py, and add the following code to detect the language of a given text.

## Step 3: Implement Language Detection for Images

Enhance the Script to Handle Images
Extend the language_recognition.py script to include image processing using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR.
- python language_recognition.py
Verify the Output
Ensure that the script correctly identifies the language for both the sample text and the image containing text.
